We will be comparing the Economic Impact that Covid has had on our Country. Based on the Congressional Research Service. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the labor market metrics for every state, economic sector, and major demographic group in the United States.  We will be looking at Regions with higher populations. Comparing the increase of cases and the increases of unemployment rates that might lead to higher housing prices and or larger sales volumes. Based on the Housing Market and Unemployment rates since the start of the Pandemic. Searching and matching Data based on records from Buyers and Sellers in the residential housing markets. Exploring how this pandemic crisis effected the cost of living across multiple cities. We'll be looking at the populations of large cities and seeing how or if the pandemic caused economic recession.



We will be pulling Data from: Sites Will listed in our Git Hub Repo.

Rough Break Down of Tasks 
Search and find relevant data

Our Objective will be to see which States had the most impact on their Housing Market do to Covid. We will be pulling data based current and past Market Values.  Covid Stats on the States that had the most cases.  And the Unemployment rates in those States. 
Prepare for data analysis


 After we pull and decided which Data best correlates with our inquiry. We can start exploring, cleaning and preparing our Data. This will involve getting that Stats on Covid Cases during the Pandemic.  Pulling the unemployment rates for each State. Then from there we can compare those factors to the Housing Market. 
 
 
Monitor/analyze/manage models
 From here we should have enough Data to Write a report and create Models that express Economic Impact that Covid did in fact have on the housing market.
