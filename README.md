#### **Goal**
The Project goal is to determine whether or not the COVID epidemic has caused permanent or long term effects on the US. As the availability and sale of homes are used as a base benchmark for economic stability and/or growth we will be comparing housing sale data with data pertaining to positive Covid cases and deaths. 

We will focus on 3 major cities and their respective states that are located  in different regions of the US; Los Angeles CA, New York New York, and Dallis Texas. The project will analyze data from the beginning of the declared pandemic; March 15,2020 and data from the latter timeframe of 2021 to determine on whether or not there are long-term implications. 

### Questions:
1. Has the long-term purchasing ability of Americans been affected by the severity of the localized pandemic environment of each location and region? 
2. In what way has the prices of homes been affected and what may that indicate for the economy?
3. Has the spread of Covid caused an increase of housing availability or has there been a decrease?


#### Sources of the Datasets to be Used

### Rough Break Down of Tasks 

**Determine the viability of current datasets.** To extract either json or if possible; csv directly from the online sources and see if the datasets we currently have are viable for our analysis. 

**Prepare for the data analysis**: After we pull and decide which Data best correlates with our inquiry. We will convert, prepare and clean our datasets. 
After the data is in a usable format we will need to convert the data into visual data and compile it onto the same graphs for comparison. 
Once the visual models are completed and analyzed we should have enough Data to prepare a report to confirm that expresses the general direction the local economies are headed towards due to the effects of the Covid pandemic.
