We will be comparing the Economic Impact that Covid had in Los Angeles, New York, Austin. Based on the Congressional Research Service. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the labor market metrics for every state, economic sector, and major demographic group in the United States.  We will be looking at these three cities comparing the increase of cases and the increases of that might lead to higher housing prices Based on the Housing Market and Unemployment rates since the start of the Pandemic. Searching and matching Data based on records from Buyers and Sellers in the residential housing markets. Exploring how this pandemic crisis affected the cost of living across the US. Looking at the populations of large cities and seeing how or if the pandemic caused economic recession. Finally what State was most affected.

Rough Break Down of Tasks 
Search and find relevant data - Our Objective will be to see which of these cities had the most impact on their Housing Market to Covid. We will be pulling data based on current and past Market Values.  Covid Stats on the States that had the most cases.  And the Unemployment rates in those States.
Prepare for the data analysis - After we pull and decide which Data best correlates with our inquiry. We can start exploring, cleaning and preparing our Data. This will involve getting that Stats on Covid Cases during the Pandemic.  Pulling the unemployment rates for each State. Then from there we can compare those factors to the Housing Market. From here we should have enough Data to Write a report and create Models that express Economic Impact that Covid did in fact have on the housing market.
