Description,"The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is identifying ​the prevalence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants by analyzing ​CDPH Genomic Surveillance Data and ​CalREDIE, CDPH's communicable disease reporting and surveillance system. Viruses mutate into new strains or variants over time. Some variants emerge and then disappear. Other variants become common and circulate for a long time. Several specialized laboratories statewide sequence the genomes of a fraction of all positive COVID-19 tests to determine which variants are circulating. Sequencing and reporting of variant results takes several days after a test is identified as a positive for COVID-19. Not all ​viruses from positive COVID-19 tests are ​sequenced. Knowing what variants are circulating in California informs public health and clinical action.

Note: There is a natural reporting lag in these data due to the time commitment to complete whole genome sequencing; therefore, a 14 day lag is applied to these datasets to allow for data completeness. Please note that more recent data should be used with caution.
