Project goal is to determine whether or not the COVID epidemic has caused permanent or long term effects onto the local economies of major economic locations in the US. We will focus on 3 major states and a corresponding city in each with a robust economy in different regions of the US; Los Angeles CA, New York New York, and Dallis Texas. 
A generalized view of the local economic strength of each state and each city will be developed based on housing availability. This data will then be used in comparison to data of Covid infection and positive cases of each corresponding city and state. 

Questions:
1: Has the long-term purchasing ability of Americans been affected by the severity of the localized pandemic environment. 
2: Is there a correlation of Covid severity in the state and Home pricing?
3: Due to Covid related medical costs; has there been an increase of housing availability or has there been a decrease?

Rough Break Down of Tasks 
18
Search and find relevant data - Our Objective will be to see which of these cities had the most impact on their Housing Market to Covid. We will be pulling data based on current and past Market Values.  Covid Stats on the States that had the most cases.  And the Unemployment rates in those States.
19
Prepare for the data analysis - After we pull and decide which Data best correlates with our inquiry. We can start exploring, cleaning and preparing our Data. This will involve getting that Stats on Covid Cases during the Pandemic.  Pulling the unemployment rates for each State. Then from there we can compare those factors to the Housing Market. From here we should have enough Data to Write a report and create Models that express Economic Impact that Covid did in fact have on the housing market.
